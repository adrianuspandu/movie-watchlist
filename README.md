# Movie Watchlist
This is one of the projects in the Scrimba Frontend Career Path.
I was able to work with the OMDb API to fetch the movie database, and although it looks
like a completed project, I'd like to address some areas for improvement in the future.  

## List of improvements that could be made:
- There's a bug where, when users click the search button repeatedly, the search results get completely messed up.  
- Currently, the CSS code is VERY NOT DRY and could be tidied up a bit.  
- The search functionality currently only shows the first 10 results.  
- The JavaScript is also not very DRY.
